        <h3>About Fallout 76</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Fallout 76</strong> is an online action role-playing game set in a post-apocalyptic version of West Virginia. 
          Players explore a vast open world, build settlements, and discover remnants of the past while surviving in the Appalachian wilderness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game’s unique setting draws heavily from Appalachian culture, folklore, and cuisine, making it a perfect inspiration for a themed cookbook website.

          It reimagines classic Wasteland dishes in a fun, immersive way that connects fans of the game with real-world cooking.
